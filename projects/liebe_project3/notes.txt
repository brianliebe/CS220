ith pagetable gives you PPN and flags (i == vpn)
each process has a pagetable.

tlb: mapping b/w virtual and physical pages & flags.
VPN | PPN | VF | DF | UF
UF - we use to it if all other values are VALID.
when you write, you set the dirty flag.

pte - page table entry

virtual mem > phys mem - (number)

from phys to virt -> use RLT
rlt[i] gives you virtual page relating to physical page of [i]
hit -> mark it used (and dirty is write=1)

if you read a vpn, you don't need to change the dirty flag.

RLT: index is PPN (important...)
